# Politics & COVID Analysis

I constructed and analyzed a COVID-19 dataset with the goal of teasing out interactions between partisanship and COVID-19 outcomes. A full write-up of my results is published on my [blog](https://peterzhang.info/politics-covid). An abbreviated version is published on the [Berkeley Economic Review](https://econreview.berkeley.edu/partisanship-and-covid-19-response/). Feel free to use the datasets, which are available in the `agglomerated` folder, just leave a reference to my repo.
