# Politics & COVID Analysis

I constructed and analyzed a COVID-19 dataset with the goal of teasing out interactions between partisanship and COVID-19 outcomes. A full write-up of my results is available [here](https://peterzhang.info/politics-covid). Feel free to use the datasets, which are available in the `agglomerated` folder. Just leave a reference to my repo.
